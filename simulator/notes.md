## GAMEPLAY:

### Election

1. **Pass the Presidential Candidacy**
   - Presidential Candidacy is passed to the left
2. **Nominate a Chancellor**
   - Chancellor Candidate is nominated by the President
     - Note: The president is allowed to discuss chancellor options
     - Note: The last _elected_ chancellor and president are term-limited and ineligible to be nominated as chancellor candidate
   - Discuss and vote on the Chancellor Candidate
3. **Vote**
   - Everyone votes on the proposed government.
   - Vote fails if there is a tie or majority vote No
     - **Special Rules:**
       - If the group rejects three governments in a row, the country is thrown into chaos
         - The top policy from the policy deck is enacted
         - All players become eligible to hold the office of Chancellor for the next Election
         - If there are fewer than three tiles remaining in the policy deck, shuffle them with the discard pile to create a new policy deck
         - Any time a new Policy tile is played face-up, the election tracker is reset
   - If a majority of players vote yes:
     - The President and Chancellor are elected
     - If three or more Fascist Policies have been enacted, ask if the new chancellor is Hitler, if so the Fascists win

### Legislative Session

- President and Chancellor work together to enact a new policy
- President draws top three tiles from the policy deck, removes one, and passes the remaining two to the Chancellor
- Chancellor enacts one of the two policies
- If there are fewer than three tiles remaining in the policy deck, shuffle them with the discard pile to create a new policy deck
- If the government enacts a Fascist Policy that covered up a Presidential Power, the President must use that power
- If the government enacted a Liberal Policy or a Fascist Policy that grants no Presidential Power, begin a new round with a new Election.

### Executive Action

- If the newly-enacted Fascist Policy grants a Presidential Power, the President must use it before the next round
- Presidential Powers are only used once
  - Investigate Loyalty: President investigates a player's party membership
  - Call Special Election: President selects the next Presidential Candidate
  - Policy Peek: President looks at the top three tiles in the policy deck
  - Execution: President kills a player
  - Veto Power: Gained only when five fascist policies are enacted, executive board has the power to veto all three policies if both the President and Chancellor agree
