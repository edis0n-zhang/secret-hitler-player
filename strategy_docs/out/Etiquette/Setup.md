### Setup

When examining your envelope, be sure to examine both your party membership and role cards **even if you are a Liberal**. Everyone should look at both their cards, otherwise you can tell who is a Fascist by whoever looked at both their cards. By looking at both cards, the game starts fairly for both teams and this cannot be used against anyone throughout. This is also important for all liberals to do since if a liberal does look at both cards you may be inclined to judge them as fascist for doing so.
