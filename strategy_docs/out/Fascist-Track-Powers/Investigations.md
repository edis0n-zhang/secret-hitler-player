### Investigations

When there is an investigation and the investigatee is called to be a Liberal, the probability of the investigatee being Liberal is slightly higher. The four possibilities are:

-   Liberal President, Liberal investigatee: Should always result in a liberal call
-   FL: The Fascist President may accuse the investigatee in order to create chaos, or they might call a Liberal to maintain cover
-   LF: Should always result in a fascist call -   See the [Experimental Strategy: The Slow Burn](#the-slow-burn)
-   FF: Most of the time the president will call liberal, but they might sometimes call fascist to cause chaos.

When there is an investigation and the investigatee is called to be a Fascist, the probability of the investigator being Hitler is low. This is due to the fact that Hitler generally wouldn't want to create a dispute and bring attention to themselves. Due to our current strategy of soft-eliminating those in a dispute, if Hitler was to create a dispute this would prevent a Hitler nomination victory.

The investigation is almost always more useful than it is a hindrance.  **Do not Brexit and lose the power**.

Chain investigations in 9/10 player games are almost always a bad idea.  They limit the amount of information you can get and can cause chaos late in the game if you draw incorrect conclusions from them. They are also difficult to trust, because at least two members of the chain will have been Fascist-playing presidents, since that's how one gets the investigation power. You should keep this in mind when nominating presidents; if a player has been investigated and called a Liberal, you should **not** vote for them as president until the second investigation power has been used. If that player is nominated and happens to draw three Fascist policies (or pretends to), then the table will have inadvertently caused a chain investigation.
