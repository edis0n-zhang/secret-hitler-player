#### As a Fascist {#as-a-fascist}

Ideally you want to kill a Liberal if you get the execution power as a Fascist. This lowers the voting power of the Liberals and can equalize the player counts in a game with an odd number of players. As the Liberals' voting power gets lower, the Fascists will have an easier time electing Fascist governments and Hitler.

You need to consider whether or not you can justify killing a Liberal player to the others. If you can, then it's safe to kill them. If not, you need to decide whether it's more valuable to your team to kill an obvious Fascist to maintain trust, or to kill a Liberal and out yourself to the table. The latter can be a good choice if it will even the team counts, or if there is a strong Liberal block which can be disrupted.  For example, if there are three Liberals who trust each other and keep cycling the governments between them, you could execute one so that the Liberals are forced to put trust in someone else -- maybe Hitler.
