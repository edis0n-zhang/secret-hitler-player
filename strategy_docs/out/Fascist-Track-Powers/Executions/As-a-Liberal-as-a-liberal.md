#### As a Liberal {#as-a-liberal}

You must be careful when you have gained the power of Assassination. The Liberals only have a narrow majority, so you must make sure you do not shoot one of your teammates. There are two real choices to make as a Liberal with the Assassination power: shoot a known Fascist or try to shoot Hitler.  There are only two ways to know for sure if someone is fascist: -   Investigation -   Be in direct dispute over a policy It is often safest to shoot whoever you are in a dispute with as a result of investigations or policy disputes. They are less likely to be Hitler, so other Liberals may question your choice, but increasing the Liberal majority is worthwhile. The alternative is to go after Hitler instead, the hard part is identifying them. Some reasons to suspect someone of being Hitler are:

-   Support from suspicious players with no prior justification.
-   As Fascists have extra knowledge, they may side with Hitler early on in an attempt to help them build trust.

If you don't know any Fascists, a more risky option is to kill the person you trust least from a dispute. As you know there is a guaranteed Fascist between them it is only a *50/50* chance of killing the wrong person. In the worst case you can use the second assassination power to kill the other member of the dispute. This ensures that you have killed *at least* one Fascist, and thus haven't unbalanced the voting. If you pick wrong with the first kill or if you do not have a second assassination this can lead to issues. It's still possible to get back in control if Hitler doesn't know who the other Fascists are.
