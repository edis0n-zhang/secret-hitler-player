#### As a Liberal {#as-a-liberal-1}

If you have activated this power then Hitler can now be nominated for a Fascist victory. You might think that the obvious choice is to give the Presidency to the player you trust the most. The problem with that is the President then needs to choose a Chancellor who is not Hitler. As such, it will often make more sense to choose a President who is not quite as trusted so that the trusted player is eligible to be nominated as the Chancellor. Another interesting strategy is to select the players one or two spaces clockwise. This player will then have two chances at electing a successful Government, so the first choice can be used as a trial to look for strange votes or reactions, then the second choice can be voted through if it seems sound.
