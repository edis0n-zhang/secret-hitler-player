#### As a Fascist {#as-a-fascist-1}

A Fascist player should usually go along with the Liberal nomination strategy, but giving the Presidency to another Fascist if possible. If you do something suspicious with your nomination, then it could cast doubt on the player you elect as your President, and the government likely won't go through either. If you are feeling particularly devious, you could try playing on suspicion to cast doubt on a Liberal player by nominating them with little justification.
