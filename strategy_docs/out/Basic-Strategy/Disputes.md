### Disputes

When there is a dispute as a result of a governmental action (e.g.  investigator claims to have seen a Fascist but the investigatee claims to be a Liberal, or president claims to have passed across a liberal that the chancellor discarded), this means that there is guaranteed to be at least one fascist within the pair. If there is a dispute, exclude both players from play where possible. This means do not elect them to government, do not investigate them, do not nominate as chancellors and do not assassinate. The reason for this is that there is too much risk following and trusting one.
