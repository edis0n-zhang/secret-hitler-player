#### As a Liberal

Since you want to ensure the play of as many Liberal policies as possible, you should nominate the player you trust the most to be chancellor. If you have little trust for any other player, you might want to pick a chancellor who has not been on a government yet to gather information on as many players as possible. Be careful when nominating a chancellor after three Fascist policies have been played, as the Fascists will win the game if Hitler is successfully nominated. Note that if Hitler is playing well, they may be one of the most trusted players in the game. As such, you need to be on the lookout for strange votes which might point to Fascists pushing for a Hitler nomination.
