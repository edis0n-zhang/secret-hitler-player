#### As Hitler

When playing as Hitler, you should nominate in the same way as a Liberal. Since you do not have knowledge of the roles of other players in the game, this should be easy. Do not worry too much about finding fellow Fascists; you should focus on making yourself a viable chancellor choice. It is usually advantageous to build trustworthy governments, as this will allow you to push for yourself to be chancellor later.

If you have managed to work out the identity of your fellow Fascists, it can be useful to have them on a government. This will allow you to collaborate to ensure Fascist policies go down. The only thing to watch out for here is whether they have suspicion on them already. If they do, this can often reflect on yourself and lead to distrust.
