#### As a Fascist

Your main choice as a Fascist President is whether to discard Liberal policies or not. On a draw of 1L2F, discarding the Liberal and forcing a Fascist play brings your team closer to victory (and maybe gives you a Fascist power), but it will also cast suspicion upon you. You need to carefully consider the current state of the game to decide whether you can get away with discarding a Liberal, or if it's worth doing even if it'll likely out you as a Fascist. It is easier to sell a 0L3F draw if lots of Liberal policies have been played since the last shuffle, since there will be fewer Liberals in the deck and you can call on the power of statistics to save you. It can also be profitable to force a Fascist play if a few Liberal Presidents have had unlucky 0L3F draws, as you add chaos to the game.

If your Chancellor is also a Fascist, you could even play a Fascist policy on a draw of 2L1F. If you do this at the wrong time or aren't convincing enough, this could out both of you as Fascists and effectively lose you the game, but it is profitable when it works. By discarding two Liberals from the deck, you make it much more likely for Liberal Presidents to draw 0L3F, thus covering up your lie somewhat. If you are going for this strategy, you should be sure to do it as soon as possible after a shuffle to get as much cover as you can. Of course, if the Fascist team is far behind, it may make sense to discard two Liberals just to give you a better chance of winning. As always, consider the trust of the table and state of the board.
