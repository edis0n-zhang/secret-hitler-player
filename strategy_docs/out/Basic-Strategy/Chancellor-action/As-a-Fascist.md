#### As a Fascist

Deciding whether or not to discard a Liberal policy when given a choice can be difficult. It will put you up on the scoreboard, but will almost certainly result in a dispute, which may cut you out of the game.  Consider how much chaos is currently at the table, how important a Fascist policy play is, how much trust the President has, and what Fascist power the President would get when making your choice.
