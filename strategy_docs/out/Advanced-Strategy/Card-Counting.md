### Card Counting

There are 17 cards in total: 6 Liberal and 11 Fascist.

In the first round of governments, there can be 5 functional governments before the deck needs to be shuffled (3 cards x 5 = 15). As such, in the first round you will see 15 cards as a group, but the remaining two will be unknown as they get shuffled back in. For the second round after the deck is shuffled, there should now be 12 cards in the deck. In round two you have the possibility of 4 governments which will then see all the cards. If you get to the end of the second deck and the game isn't over, there will only be one more government after the shuffle.

Causing a failed government three times (also known as Brexit or breakfast) will disrupt this order. In round 1 if you vote past the governments twice you can see all the cards. In round 2 the failed vote will result in more cards being hidden.
