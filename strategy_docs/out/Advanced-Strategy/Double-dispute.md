### Double dispute

Sometimes it works for Fascists to create a double dispute. For example, if an investigation is coming up and the President is Fascist:

1.  The President forces the Chancellor to play a Fascist policy and then claims that they were given a choice.
2.  The President investigates a Liberal and claims that they are Fascist.

Since three people are in dispute, it is more difficult to exclude them from the game and players would be forced to take sides.
