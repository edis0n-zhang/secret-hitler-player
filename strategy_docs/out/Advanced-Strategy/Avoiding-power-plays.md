### Avoiding power plays

Until you have some information it is best to vote down a President nominating a Chancellor who could then be President in the next round.  If someone is on the government two plays in a row then they have a lot of power to influence the game, and if you are Liberal you don't know whether that person is Fascist or not. As such, Liberals should vote down such nominations to avoid giving Fascists power and Fascists should vote down such governments so as to not give themselves away. Our group tends to nominate the player directly counter-clockwise from them if they don't have any better idea. When it is time for a Hitler nomination or there is some trust at the table, then you can feel free to vote in power plays.
