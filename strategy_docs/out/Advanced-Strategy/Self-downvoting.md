### Self-downvoting

When unsure about your Chancellor choice, voting against your own candidate can provide information through the other player's votes.  Where possible, have the next President (who you deem likely a Liberal) also vote for the same Chancellor. If unsure (Hitler has been enabled) get the next two Presidents to follow the tactic.
