### Hitler

Hitler has the most sensitive role, as they can bring about an early victory or defeat for the Fascists. A good Hitler player can worm their way into the Liberal block and get themselves nominated while still playing Fascist cards when they think they can get away with it. A poor one may get discovered and make themselves a prime target for execution powers, undermining any results the other Fascists have been achieving.

The most basic Hitler strategy is to just play as a straight Liberal.  Try to make all the same decisions you would make as a Liberal player; playing Liberal policies, discovering Fascists, voting conservatively.  If you can do this well, you should have a reasonable amount of trust from the Liberal players to get you voted in as chancellor when it matters. Of course, with this strategy you are relying on the regular Fascists to enact the policies you need to win the game, but a straight Liberal Hitler play is a good idea if you aren't comfortable trying more advanced tactics.

When you are more familiar with the game, you can try selectively discarding Liberal policies when you can plausibly deny doing so.  However, try not to get in disputes with other players, as you could quickly find yourself cut out of the game with no chance of being elected for that early victory.
