### Liberals

As a Liberal, your aim is to ensure that Liberal policies are enacted and to discover Fascists in order to execute or soft-eliminate them.

Liberals should tell the truth about what they see, play, and discard.  This is useful so that the Liberals have the maximum amount of information available to them when making decisions. If a Liberal is caught lying about something, it can seriously undermine their trust and make it easier for Fascists to infiltrate the Liberal block.

Where possible, you want to pass or play Liberal policies. As a President or Chancellor, you will want to ensure that a Liberal is played if you see one. As such, the default strategy is to simply pass one across or play one if you have been given it. This is a good all-round strategy that brings the liberals closer to victory.

If you are a Liberal, don't say that you're Fascist. Some players do this to make it easier for them to be nominated when they *are* Fascist, but it just makes other players less likely to vote for their governments. If you do this as a Liberal, you are just harming your team.
