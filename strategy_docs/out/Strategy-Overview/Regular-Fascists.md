### Regular Fascists

Fascists want to sow as much dissent and chaos as possible, giving confused Liberals a path to bring about their own demise. However you must watch out that you do not trip up over your own lies.

Most of the time Fascists should pretend they are Liberals, only furthering the Fascist agenda when they have plausible deniability. A player who does this well will be able to curry favour with the Liberals, allowing them to subtly continue with their deceit, biding their time for a merciless betrayal when it counts the most.

Fascists should also do their best to help Hitler gain trust so that they can be elected chancellor and win the game. This usually involves allowing them to play Liberal policies and attempting to eliminate other players from the game to clear the way. But be careful not to support Hitler *too* much, or the Liberal players might catch on!
