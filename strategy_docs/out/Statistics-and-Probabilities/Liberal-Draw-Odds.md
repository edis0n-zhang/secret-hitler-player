### Liberal Draw Odds

The first government of the policy deck is often the most important and most revealing about a player's action. It is only during this point in the game that all players know the number of liberal cards in the deck.  From this we can work out the odds of drawing at least one liberal card at these stages. After governments have passed this becomes harder due to the possibilities that players have lied.

With the table below we can work out what the odds are that at least one liberal will be drawn based on any permutation of government. The y-axis is the number of presumed or known liberal cards still in the deck, the x-axis is the total number of cards currently in the deck. For example in the first round of the game we know that there will be 17 cards in total (6 liberal and 11 fascist). As a government draws three cards, the chances of them drawing at least one liberal is around 75%.
