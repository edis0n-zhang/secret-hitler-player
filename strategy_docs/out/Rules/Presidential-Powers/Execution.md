#### Execution

The President executes one player at the table by saying "I formally execute \[player name\]."

If that player is Hitler, the game ends in a Liberal victory. If the executed player is not Hitler, the table will not know for sure if they have killed a Fascist or a Liberal; Liberals must try to work out for themselves whether the right person was killed.

Executed players are removed from the game and may not speak, vote, or be elected as part of government.

It is also recommended that Executed players do not interfere with the game in any way, including by looking at other players' cards. These innocuous actions can often accidentally reveal your true party allegiance.
