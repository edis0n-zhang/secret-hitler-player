#### Special Election

The president can choose any other player to be the next president, even those who were in the previous government. The selected player can choose a chancellor and the election proceeds as normal.

Once the election is over, the next president returns to the normal rules - ie. the next player clockwise to the president who obtained the ability.

This can allow the player to the left of the president to become the nominated president twice in a row.
