### The Flip-Flop

Early voting can be unproportionally counted on compared to other votes.  In the first round of voting, Fascists have the advantage and it is likely that Liberals will vote against, wasting a potential government.  Flip-flopping between games can help mitigate this due to balancing skeptical Liberals to optimistic ones. WARNING: This has a side effect of unpredictable player meta; players may see you as untrustworthy because they cannot reason about your initial vote - especially if you were next in line to be President.
