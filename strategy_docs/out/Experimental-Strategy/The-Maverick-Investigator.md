### The Maverick Investigator

Liberal President forces their Chancellor to play a fascist to receive the investigation power (only available in 6+ player games) to investigate their Chancellor. An extension to this play happens when the Liberal President finds their Chancellor is a Fascist but informs the other players that they are Liberal. The reaction of the Fascist Chancellor may reveal if the Chancellor is a Fascist or Hitler. Hitler would not react to the move, whereas a Fascist may be startled by answer.
