### The Robin Hood

Being Liberal president, discarding liberals and forcing chancellor to play fascist to get power. Doing this if the Liberals are not ahead on the board is usually a bad idea as it will reduce the trust for the president. Do **not** do this on the first turn of a 9/10 player game, as the Liberals will find it very difficult to bring back the deficit as Fascists will be able to hide more easily and the Liberals will likely not trust the investigation.
