# What We Did
We made LLMs play the popular deception game Secret Hitler.

# How We Did It
1. Passed in relevant information to each player: Their known information (board state, fascists if they are a fascist, etc.)
2. Got relevant strategy to the stage using RAG and calling a vector database
3. The rules of the stage and their goal
4. Gave a history of the discussions between players (discussed before voting and after enacting a policy)
